Once upon a time, nestled in a valley far beyond the Whispering Woods, lived a tiny star named Celeste .

Celeste wasn't like the big, bright stars that shouted their light across the cosmos. She was a little shy, and her light was just a soft, silvery flicker, no bigger than a firefly .

Celeste worried that no one could really see her. "What good is a tiny light like mine?" she sighed one night to the moon, Luna.

Luna, wise and quiet, just smiled. " Celeste, your light travels a long way, but it finds the places the big lights miss."

Celeste didn't understand, until one dark, cloudy night when all the grand, shining stars were hidden. Down on Earth, a little boy named Leo was lost on a winding forest path. Leo was afraid of the dark, and all he could see were the thick shadows of the trees.

He looked up, hoping for a moonbeam, but the clouds were too heavy. Then, through a small, unexpected tear in the clouds a tiny hole no bigger than Leo's thumb a single, soft, silvery flicker peeked through. It was Celeste's light.

It wasn't enough to light the whole path, but it landed right on a smooth, grey stepping stone that Leo hadn't noticed. Taking a deep breath, Leo stepped onto the stone. The light shifted, finding the next stone, and the next.

Celeste, high above, felt a strange warmth. She wasn't shining brightly, but she was shining purposefully. Her little light, the one she thought was too small, was exactly the right size to mark one step at a time for a boy who only needed to see the next step.

When Leo finally reached his cozy, candlelit home, he looked up, and though the clouds had closed again, he felt grateful for the tiny light that guided him.

Celeste watched him safely tucked into bed. She realized that even the smallest light has a powerful job to shine exactly where it is needed, reminding everyone that all you really need to see is one step ahead.

And with that happy thought, little Celeste flickered gently, ready for a well-deserved sleep, knowing her soft, silvery light was absolutely perfect.

Sweet dreams.
